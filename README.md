# Generative models 🔮

In this repository we propose `pytorch` implementations for several **generative models**. A generative model can be seen as a model that learns the 
structure of a dataset and then is able to generate new samples faithful to the dataset content.

## Models 📚

You can find in this repository an implementation of the following generative models:

- [x] [auto_encoder](auto_encoder/) : A basic auto encoder network
- [x] [simple_gan](simple_gan/) : A vanilla Generative Adversarial Network
- [ ] *Other models coming soon*

## Requirements ☝️

The `requirements.txt` file provide all required python modules to be able to run the codes presented. You can install all of those packages directly in
your working environment with pip : 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
